# MSc-Thesis
In this study, I will compare video based deep learning face recognition systems.
First aim is to working on Openface project which is developped by Carnegie Mellon University and licensed under the Apache 2.0 License(https://cmusatyalab.github.io/openface/). The code can be downloaded from github(https://github.com/cmusatyalab/openface).
We will have 2 datasets. UvA-NEMO Smile Database (http://www.uva-nemo.org/) and for the other we will decide soon.
The second deep learning system will be VGG. We will compare the results with these datasets.

You will find the technical details in the techNotes folder.
